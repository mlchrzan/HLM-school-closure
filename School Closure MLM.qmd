  summary()
```

## Step 1

```{r}
m1 <- glm(closed ~ 1 ,
         data = closure_CA, 
         family = 'binomial')
summary(m1)
```

```{r}
logLik(m1) #deviance
```

## Step 2

```{r random-intercept}
m2 <- glmer(closed ~ (1 | agency_id),  
            data = closure_CA, 
            family = 'binomial') 

summary(m2)
```

```{r icc}
icc(m2)
```

```{r anova-m2-m1}
(2* logLik(m2)) - (2* logLik(m1))

anova(m2,m1)
```

## Step 3: A model with a level 1 predictor

```{r variables}
#SCHOOL LEVEL
#pct_dist_enroll
#st_ratio
#school_level
#school_more_diverse ???

#DISTRICT LEVEL
#dist_five_year_enroll 
#dist_st_ratio
#dist_per_pupil_expend
#num_schools
```

```{r level-1-predictors}
m3 <- glmer(closed ~ pct_dist_enroll + st_ratio + school_level + (1 | agency_id),  
            data = closure_CA, 
            family = "binomial") 

summary(m3)
```

```{r model-comparison-2}
anova(m3, m2)
#(2* logLik(m2)) - (2* logLik(m1))
#(2* logLik(m3)) - (2* logLik(m2))

#Not nested models! There was some listwise deletion from one of the covariates missing variables

#Take out all the missing values after selecting the variables, do some naniar analysis on the missing data 

# logLik(m1)
# logLik(m2)
# logLik(m3)
```

## Step 4 a model with level 2 predictors

```{r level-2-predictors}
#DISTRICT LEVEL
#dist_five_year_enroll 
#dist_st_ratio
#dist_per_pupil_expend
#num_schools

m4 <- glmer(closed ~ pct_di5st_enroll + st_ratio + school_level 
            + three_yr_enroll_dist + dist_st_ratio + dist_per_pupil_expend 
            + dist_num_schools + (1 | agency_id),  
            data = closure_CA, 
            family = "binomial") 

summary(m4)
```
