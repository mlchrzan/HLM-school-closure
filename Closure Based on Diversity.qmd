div_study_std <- div_study |> 
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric) & !year, scale),
         across(where(is.numeric) & !year, as.vector), 
         year = year - min(year)) 

div_study_std 
```

## Step 1: Base Model with Time Predictor

Hypothesis: Districts do not close the same number of schools at the start

```{r base-model-time}
m1_div <- lm(num_closed ~ I(year * year) ,            
         data = div_study_std) 

summary(m1_div) 
```

```{r model-random-intercept}
m2_div <- lmer(num_closed ~ I(year * year) + (1 | agency_id),
           data = div_study_std,     
           REML = F)  

summary(m2_div) 
```

```{r compare-m1-m2}
anova(m2_div, m1_div) 
```

```{r icc}
icc(m2_div)
```

## Step 2: Model with time-varying predictors

NOTE: Smaller Theil Index =\> More Diverse, Larger Theil Index =\> Less Diverse

Hypothesis:

-   Increases in district Theil indexes over time ***negatively*** relates to number of closures

    -   Given the research that in CA the proportion of black students predicts closures, it would seem if there were less white students there would be less closures

-   Increases in the school Theil indexes over time ***positively*** relates to number of closures

    -   If a school is becoming less diverse, it is less likely to close, given the result discussed in the previous point

-   Increases in the num_schools over time would ***positively*** relate to number of closures

    -   If a district has more schools over time, it may start to strain its budget

-   Increases in the tot_students over time would ***negatively*** relate to number of closures

    -   More students would typically mean more revenue which the district could use to stave off needing to close schools to manage finances, a major consideration listed when closing schools

-   Increased st_ratio over time ***positively*** relates to number of closures

    -   Increased st_ratio would indicate a district being in more financial trouble, so it would make sense that they would wind up closing schools over time

-   Increases in the pct_frpl over time ***positively*** relates to number of closures

    -   If a district starts serving more low-income students, the surrounding context of the school is probably one that struggles to support its schools financially

```{r model-time-varying}
m3_div <- lmer(num_closed ~ 
           + I(year * year)
           + I(theil * theil)
           + avg_schl_theil
           + st_ratio
           + I(num_schools * num_schools)
           + I(tot_students * tot_students)
           + I(pct_frpl * pct_frpl)
           + (1 | agency_id),
           data = div_study_std,
           REML = F)

summary(m3_div) 
```

```{r compare-m2-m3}
anova(m3_div, m2_div) 
```

## *No time invariant predictors, so we skip Step 3*

## Step 4 a model with level 2 predictors

Hypothesis: Non-rural districts close more schools, with urban schools closing more than suburban

```{r model-level-2}
m4_div <- lmer(num_closed ~ 
           + I(year * year)
           + I(theil * theil)
           + avg_schl_theil
           + st_ratio
           + I(num_schools * num_schools)
           + I(tot_students * tot_students)
           + I(pct_frpl * pct_frpl)
           + location_type
           + (1 | agency_id),
           data = div_study_std,
           REML = F)

summary(m4_div) 
```

```{r compare-m3-m4}
anova(m4_div, m3_div) 
```

## Step 5: A model with random slopes (NO covariance with random intercepts)

Hypothesis: Number of school's effect on the number of closures will vary by district as districts of different sizes would approach the problems that typical indicate a need to close schools differently (e.g., larger districts may close buildings, but co-locate schools if they have more space)

```{r model-rand-slopes-NO-cov}
m5_div <- lmer(num_closed ~ 
           + I(year * year)
           + I(theil * theil)
           + avg_schl_theil
           + st_ratio
           + I(num_schools * num_schools)
           + I(tot_students * tot_students)
           + I(pct_frpl * pct_frpl)
           + location_type
           + (1 | agency_id)
           + (0 + num_schools | agency_id),
           data = div_study_std,
           REML = F)

summary(m5_div) 
```

```{r compare-m4-m5}
anova(m5_div, m4_div) 
```

## A model with random slopes (and covariance with random intercepts)

```{r model-rand-slopes-cov}
m6_div <- lmer(num_closed ~ 
           + I(year * year)
           + I(theil * theil)
           + avg_schl_theil
           + st_ratio
           + I(num_schools * num_schools)
           + I(tot_students * tot_students)
           + I(pct_frpl * pct_frpl)
           + location_type
           + (1 + num_schools | agency_id),
           data = div_study_std,
           REML = F) 

# summary(m6_div)

# Sigularity!
```

## Step 6: A model with cross-level interaction

Hypothesis: The effect of time differs based on the number of schools. Over time, districts with a larger number of schools will close more of them.

```{r model-cross-lvl-interaction}
m7_div <- lmer(num_closed ~ 
           + I(year * year)
           + I(theil * theil)
           + avg_schl_theil
           + st_ratio
           + I(num_schools * num_schools)
           + I(tot_students * tot_students)
           + I(pct_frpl * pct_frpl)
           + location_type
           + (1 | agency_id)
           + (0 + num_schools | agency_id) 
           + I(num_schools * year),
           data = div_study_std,
           REML = F)

summary(m7_div) 
```

```{r compare-m6-m7}
anova(m7_div, m5_div) 
```

## Check with REML (restricted maximum likelihood)

```{r m7-wtih-REML}
m7_REML <- lmer(num_closed ~ 
           + I(year * year)
           + I(theil * theil)
           + avg_schl_theil
           + st_ratio
           + I(num_schools * num_schools)
           + I(tot_students * tot_students)
           + I(pct_frpl * pct_frpl)
           + location_type
           + (1 | agency_id)
           + (0 + num_schools | agency_id) 
           + I(num_schools * year),
           data = div_study_std,
           REML = T)


# Compare with and without REML
tab_model(m7_div, m7_REML,
           dv.labels = c("Non-REML", 
                         "REML"),
           show.se = FALSE,
           show.dev = TRUE,
           p.style = 'stars',
           show.ci = FALSE) 

# with and without REML produce similar results 
```

# Inspecting residual plots

```{r qqplot}
r_std <- scale(resid(m6_div))
qqnorm(r_std, pch = 1) 
qqline(r_std, col = "#8C1515")
```

The qqplot shows that the individual level residuals are not normally distributed across their own normal score, mostly at the extremes (indication that the relationship is not linear).

```{r residual-cloud}
div_study_std <- mutate(div_study_std, num_closed_hat_ml = fitted(m6_div))

ggplot(div_study_std,
       aes(x = num_closed_hat_ml, 
           y = r_std)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Predicted number closed") +
  ylab("Standardized residuals") + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "#8C1515") 
```

Residual plots shows the residuals are not normally distributed across the predicted values of the number of school's closed.

```{r}
ranef <- as.data.frame(ranef(m6_div)[1]) 
ranef <- ranef |> 
  mutate(agency_id = row.names(ranef)) |> 
  as_tibble()

randomeffects <- ranef |>
  rename(random_intercept = agency_id..Intercept., 
         random_slope = agency_id.num_schools) |>
  inner_join(div_study_std, 
             by = join_by(agency_id))


ggplot(randomeffects, 
       aes(x = num_closed_hat_ml, 
           y = random_intercept)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Predicted number closed") +
  ylab("Intercept") + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, 
             color = "#8C1515")


ggplot(randomeffects, aes(x = num_closed_hat_ml, 
                          y = random_slope)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Predicted number closed") +
  ylab("Slope") + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, 
             color = "#8C1515") 
```

Many outliers, but even for the tighter group in the center, for higher values of num_closed there are more positive values of residuals.

```{r catepillar-plots}
u_condvar <- ranef(m6_div, condVar = TRUE)
varcovar <- attr(u_condvar$agency_id, "postVar")
myplots <- list()

# for each random effect
for (i in 1:length(u_condvar$agency_id)) {
  # select the random parameter value
  myu <- u_condvar$agency_id[i]
  names(myu) <- "myu"
  # select the variance, take the square root to get the standard error
  myu_se <- apply(varcovar, 3, function(x) sqrt(x[i,i]))   
  # combine them and arrange my myu and add a rank
  u_se <- as_tibble(cbind(myu, myu_se)) |>
    arrange(myu) |>
    mutate(rank = 1:1071)
  # and store the plots in a list with two elements
  myylabs <- c("Intercept", "Slope")
  myplots[[i]] <- ggplot(u_se, aes(x = rank, y = myu)) +
    geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = myu - (myu_se * 1.39), ymax = myu + (myu_se * 1.39))) + 
    geom_point() +
    geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "red") +
    ylab(myylabs[i]) +
    xlab("Rank") +
    theme_minimal()
}    


myplots[[1]]
myplots[[2]]  
```

Here the districts are sorted in rank order of their residuals around the average intercept. When error bars do not overlap, they will have significantly different residuals (p \< 0.05). It shows us how different the intercepts are across districts.
